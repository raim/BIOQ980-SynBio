## Why Platereader?

### Shakeflask vs. Platereader Cultures

1. Data Analysis
    * many replicates, many conditions
	* different statistics required
2. Endpoint vs. Kinetics
    * steady-state vs. dynamics

<oq>Are tube and platereader cultures comparable?</oq><br/>
<oq>Why Timeseries?</oq><br/>
<oq>Why (not)?</oq>

The concept of "balanced growth" is flawed, yet a central assumption
of many quantitative models.
